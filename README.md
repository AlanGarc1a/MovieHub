# MovieHub

MovieHub is a web application that uses the IMDB API to display movies and TV Shows that users want to know about and look up.

# Motivation

To create a web application using the IMDB API. I was looking around on the dribble website for movie streaming design and saw a design that I really liked and wanted to take that design and build it using React.js. Also, I wanted to get familiar using TypeScript and to use TypeScript with React.js.
